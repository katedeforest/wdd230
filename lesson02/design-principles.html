        <p>
          Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their
          order of importance and help users understand information easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Netflix does this well by having their main purpose in large text in
          the center of the screen. Then the viewer's eye may flow to the bright
          red elements on the page which point out significant details, and then
          to the smaller white text which provide further details.

        <p>
          Hicks Law is used to simplify choices and remove barriers in
          decision-making. Deciding which menu item to get can be difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mo' Bettahs simplifies this choice on their website by having only one
          menu item on their main page and telling the viewer to try that item.

        <p>
          Clean design typically means uncluttered and simple. It can mean
          removing distractions and focusing on the content, the key message,
          and the most important action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Duolingo does this by removing all unimportant elements from their
          main page. They simply have some engaging illustrations, a little text
          to tell you the purpose of their tool, and provide a button to sign in
          or get started. There is plenty of white space around these elements
          to help draw attention to them.
