      <h3>Bountiful Foods</h3>
      <p>
        Bountiful Foods is small business specializing in organic, locally grown
        foods. They are physically located in Carlsbad, California, however,
        they have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles
        to San Diego. The company sells fruits and produce directly from the
        farmers in the area, but also uses some national and international
        suppliers. The owner-operated company caters to walk in traffic at their
        storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, their food trucks. They deliver
        and manage those orders on the phone and via the website. The mission is
        to provide fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to
        order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to
        tourists visiting the coastal areas. The theme should support healthy
        eating, organic bounty, and convenience.
