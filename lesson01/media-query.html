        <p>
          Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say
          unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to
          pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.

        <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>
          And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and
          do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord
          giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men, save he shall
          cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he
          commandeth them.
