        <h2>Carlsbad</h2>
        <p>
          Carlsbad, located along the picturesque coastline of northern San
          Diego County, California, is a vibrant city with a population of
          around 115,000 people. Renowned for its stunning beaches, including
          Carlsbad State Beach and South Carlsbad State Beach, the city is a
          popular tourist destination. Carlsbad boasts a diverse economy, with a
          focus on technology, tourism, healthcare, and manufacturing, including
          the presence of the Carlsbad Research Center. Families are drawn to
          the area for its excellent school system, served by the Carlsbad
          Unified School District, and there are also higher education
          opportunities at MiraCosta College. Beyond its beautiful natural
          scenery, Carlsbad offers attractions such as LEGOLAND California
          Resort, the Flower Fields at Carlsbad Ranch, and the historic Leo
          Carrillo Ranch. The city enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with mild
          winters and warm summers, making it an appealing year-round
          destination for residents and visitors alike.
